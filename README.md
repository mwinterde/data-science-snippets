# Data Science Snippets

In this repository I will collect short notebooks that deal with a particular data science problem.

I differentiate between three levels of learning:
* :wrench: action : This is the smallest unit of learning. It is about individual work steps and useful programming methods.
* :notebook: concept : This is about a theoretical understanding of larger data analysis and machine learning concepts.
* :surfer: case : Here I practice applying the actions and concepts I have learned based on real world problems.
